Hickle is an HDF5 based clone of Pickle. Instead of serializing to a pickle
file, Hickle dumps to an HDF5 file. It is designed to be as similar to pickle
in usage as possible, providing a load() and dump() function.

## Notes

Hickle has two main advantages over Pickle:
1) LARGE PICKLE HANDLING. Unpickling a large pickle is slow, as the Unpickler
reads the entire pickle thing and loads it into memory. In comparison, HDF5
files are designed for large datasets. Things are only loaded when accessed.

2) CROSS PLATFORM SUPPORT. Attempting to unpickle a pickle pickled on Windows
on Linux and vice versa is likely to fail with errors like "Insecure string
pickle". HDF5 files will load fine, as long as both machines have
h5py installed.

3) pickle.dumps() and pickle.loads() functions can be mimicked by passing
a BytesIO type to hickle.dump() or hickle.load() function and setting the
filename parameter to a non empty string.

    hicklestring = BytesIO()
    hickle.dump(my_data,hicklestring,mode='w',filename='<string>')

    loaded_data = hickle.load(hicklestring,mode='r',filename='<string>')

             the group (or file) in an open HDF5-file that must be used.

    mode (str): optional
        string indicating how the file shall be opened. For details see Python `open`.
        
        Note: The 'b' flag is optional as all files are and have to be opened in
            binary mode.

        Path within HDF5-file or group to dump to/load from.

            { custom = True }
        would enforce use of custom loaders on all classes
        registered with this kind of loader.
